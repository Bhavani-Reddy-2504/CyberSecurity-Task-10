Task 10 – Firewall Configuration and Logging Analysis

Firewall utility was checked on the Kali Linux system.
Firewall rules were reviewed to understand default security posture.

Firewall logging was enabled successfully.
Attempted access to firewall log files showed restricted or unavailable
log paths, which is expected behavior in certain Linux configurations.

Firewall rule definitions were reviewed using the firewall rules file.
The rules indicate controlled inbound access and default deny behavior.

Observations:
- Firewall rules are active and effective.
- Logging improves monitoring and security awareness.
- Restricted access to logs is a common security hardening measure.

Conclusion:
The task confirms that firewall configuration and logging are essential
components of system security. The firewall is functioning as expected
in a controlled lab environment.

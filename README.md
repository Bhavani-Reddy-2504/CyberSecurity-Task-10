# Task 10 – Firewall Configuration and Logging (UFW)

## Overview
This task focuses on understanding and configuring firewall rules using
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) in a Linux environment. The objective is to
analyze firewall status, enable logging, review firewall rules, and
observe how firewall mechanisms protect a system from unauthorized
network access.

The task was performed in a controlled and ethical lab environment for
educational purposes only.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- UFW (Firewall Utility)
- Terminal

## Objectives
- Understand firewall concepts
- Check firewall status and rules
- Enable firewall logging
- Analyze firewall rule configuration
- Review firewall-related logs and rule files

## Methodology
1. Verified firewall availability on the system.
2. Reviewed existing firewall rules.
3. Enabled firewall logging to monitor traffic.
4. Attempted to view firewall logs and analyzed system behavior.
5. Opened and reviewed the firewall rules configuration file.
6. Documented all observations with screenshots and analysis.

## Files Included
- `analysis.txt` – Observations and technical findings
- `report.md` – Detailed firewall configuration report
- `firewall_rules.txt` – Firewall rule definitions
- `screenshots/` – Evidence of executed commands and outputs

## Outcome
This task provided practical exposure to firewall management and logging.
It demonstrated how firewall rules and logging contribute to system
security by controlling and monitoring network traffic.
